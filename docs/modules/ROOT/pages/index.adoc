= Quarkus Morphium Extension

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

The Quarkus Morphium extension integrates link:{morphium-github-url}[Morphium], an actively
maintained MongoDB ORM for Java, into Quarkus via CDI.

== Features

* *Zero-boilerplate injection* – inject `Morphium` directly via `@Inject`; the extension manages the full lifecycle
* *Declarative transactions* – `@MorphiumTransactional` for automatic commit / rollback with CDI lifecycle events
* *Type-safe configuration* – all settings live under the `quarkus.morphium.*` prefix in `application.properties`
* *Dev Services* – a MongoDB container is started automatically in dev and test mode; no manual Docker setup needed
* *Health checks* – MicroProfile liveness, readiness, and startup probes registered automatically
* *SSL/TLS & X.509* – encrypted connections and client-certificate authentication
* *GraalVM native ready* – all `@Entity` and `@Embedded` classes are registered for reflection at build time
* *Blocking call detection* – warns when Morphium writes are called from the Vert.x event loop
* *Dev UI card* – shows MongoDB connection info in the Quarkus Dev UI at `/q/dev-ui/`
* *Fast tests* – use the `InMemDriver` profile from `quarkus-morphium-testing` for instant, container-free tests
